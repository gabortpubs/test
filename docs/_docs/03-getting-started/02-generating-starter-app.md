To learn more about how you can create applications that can take advantage of {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} capabilities, generate a starter application. The starter application can produce and consume messages, and you can specify the topic where you want to send messages to.

To generate the applicaiton:
1. {{site.data.reuse.maven_prereq}}
2. Log in to your {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} UI.
2. Click the **Generate a starter application** tile or click the **Toolbox** tab.
3. Go to the **Starter application** section and click **Generate application**.
4. Provide a name for the application and set the programming language to be used for the application.
5. Decide whether you want the application to produce or consume messages, or both.
6. Specify a target topic for the messages from the application.
7. Click **Generate**. The application is created.
8. Download the compressed file and extract the file to a preferred location.
9. Navigate to the extracted file, and run the following command to build and deploy the application: <br />`mvn install liberty:run-server`
10. Access your application by using the URL provided on the UI.
11. Click **Close and go to topics** to see your topic and check the messages generated by the application.
