“Rohan can implement ES updates, such as helm updates, without service interruption.”

Event Streams version update. This can  be a Fix Pack update or upgrade to the next release.

**DRAFT COMMENT:** _Ask later - Emma and Erik looking into it, and this would not be for GA but for post-GA. Worth writing it up though if we have the info._
